Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs
=====================================

Code for ["HashGAN: Deep Learning to Hash with Pair Conditional Wasserstein GAN"](http://ise.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/~mlong/doc/hashgan-cvpr18.pdf).


## Prerequisites

- Python2, NumPy, TensorFlow, SciPy, Matplotlib
- A recent NVIDIA GPU

## Models

Configuration for th models is specified in a list of constants at the top of
the file, you can use the following command to run it:

- `python main.py`
